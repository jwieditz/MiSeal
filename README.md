# MiSeal
This project includes the MiSeal algorithm for separating a given minutiae pattern into necessary and random minutiae. Moreover, we provide a graphical tool for investigating a selected number of a fingerprint's features such as its orientation field (OF), ridge frequency as well as its OFs divergence field and the intensity of necessary minutiae within patches.
